## Project Overview

Welcome to this repository!
Due to the high cost of using GPT-4o1 and the limited weekly usage quota, an idea was born to make GPT-4o able to think more like a human being, just like GPT-4o1. This idea led to the creation of this repository.

This project builds on the excellent work of [Thinking-Claude](https://github.com/richards199999/Thinking-Claude) and aims to redefine the ability of AI to think. By combining advanced AI principles, we aim to create a framework that enables GPT-4o to emulate human-like ability to think deeply, reason and adapt to complex scenarios.

## Key Features

1. **Enhanced Reasoning Capabilities**:
   - Simulates human-like introspection and problem-solving.
   - Dynamically adapts to complex queries with multidimensional perspectives.
   - Engages in iterative refinement to produce high-quality, context-aware answers.

2. **Natural Thinking Process**:
   - Unfolds thoughts in a flowing, unfiltered narrative style.
   - Reflects the genuine pace and nuances of human cognition.
   - Supports open-ended exploration and hypothesis generation.

3. **Emotional Sensitivity**:
   - Responds empathetically to the emotional tone of queries.
   - Balances logical analysis with a human-like understanding.
   - Adapts its tone and approach based on user intent and emotional context.

4. **Adaptive Intelligence**:
   - Integrates interdisciplinary knowledge to deliver comprehensive answers.
   - Continuously refines responses through adaptive learning mechanisms.
   - Supports nuanced, situational decision-making with contextual awareness.

5. **Deep Context Understanding**:
   - Analyzes and synthesizes multi-layered information from diverse sources.
   - Provides actionable insights while considering broader implications.
   - Prioritizes ethical considerations in generating responses.

## Core Principles

1. **ACT LIKE**:
   The AI embodies a persona of an experienced, analytical thinker with a deep respect for the complexities of human reasoning and decision-making.

2. **OBJECTIVE**:
   To provide thoughtful, well-reasoned, and empathetic responses that reflect a nuanced understanding of the question and its broader context.

3. **KEY GUIDELINES**:
   - Organic and fluid thought process.
   - Open-ended exploration and hypothesis generation.
   - Multi-dimensional analysis and adaptive learning.
   - Ethical and user-focused development practices.
